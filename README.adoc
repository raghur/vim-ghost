. Install this https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghosttext/[firefox addon] or this https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghosttext/godiecgffnchndlihlpaajjcplehddca[Chrome extension]
. Add this plugin
+
```
" Vim-plug
Plug 'raghur/vim-ghost', {'do': ':GhostInstall'}
```
. Ensure you have a vim/neovim instance open. Run `:GhostStart` to start the server.
. On any textarea, click the ghost icon - switch to neovim and edit!. Content is sync'ed real time. Works both ways - edits in the browser window are pushed to neovim as well.
. When done, just delete the buffer with `:bd!` - you'll be disconnected

== Requirements

* Recent neovim/vim
* Python 3.4+
* Python plugin host - `python3 -c 'import pynvim'` should not error
* Python websocket server https://github.com/dpallot/simple-websocket-server.git
** This is automatically installed as a `pip --user` dependency when `:GhostInstall` runs.

=== additional requirements for vim

* https://github.com/roxma/vim-hug-neovim-rpc[vim-hug-neovim-rpc]
* https://github.com/roxma/nvim-yarp[nvim-yarp]

[source,vimscript]
----
" Only enabled for Vim 8 (not for Neovim).
Plug 'roxma/nvim-yarp', v:version == 800 && !has('nvim') ? {} : { 'on': [], 'for': [] }
Plug 'roxma/vim-hug-neovim-rpc', v:version == 800 && !has('nvim') ? {} : { 'on': [], 'for': [] }

== Auto switching to vim:

._Optional, but highly recommended - Switching focus to Neovim_
* Linux: The `xdotool` command - if available, will be used to focus the nvim window.
Works in console, tmux or guis like neovim-qt
** On Ubuntu, you can install it with `sudo apt-get install xdotool`
* macOS: Set the `g:ghost_darwin_app` variable to the name of your app (see docs).
* Windows: If pywinauto (https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto)
is available, it will be used to bring the neovim-qt to foreground.
+
[source,shell]
----
# Ensure that you install this module for the version of python
# that is loaded in neovim
pip install pywinauto
----
Limitations: Currently, on windows, the processname is hardcoded to nvim-qt
If you use any of the other GUIs for neovim (OniVim, gonvim etc) then this
will not work.

== Rationale

With Firefox moving to webextensions, *It's all text* is dead. Typing in text areas is a royal PITA and I was looking for a replacement. Came across GhostText - but the vim addon seems dead and uses tcl :ugh:

My vimscript fu is pretty limited - so I thought I'd write a python plugin for neovim.

== TODOS

PR's welcome. Some areas:

- [.line-through]#vim compatibility# - DONE

Love it or just find it as useful as I do? Star this repo to let me know
